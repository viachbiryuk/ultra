# Ultra 
Test application

## How to run 
1. Make sure you have _docker_ and _docker-compose_ installed on your machine
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `docker-compose up` in the application directory - this will spin up API on  `http://localhost:9001`

## NB!
1. `.env` file is committed on purpose to ease the demonstration process
2. You can import `insomnia-workspace` into your Insonmia workspaces to test API using GUI
